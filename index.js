// const express = require("express");
// // First we import (require) the express module
// const app = express();
// // Then we use it to create a server (app)
// const port = 3000;
// // Which listens for requests on port 3000 and responds explaining what browser URL you can use to test the server

// app.get("/", (req, res) => {
//     res.send("Hello World!");
// });

// app.listen(port, () => {
//     console.log(`Example app listening on port: ${port}!`);
// });

// Next we can start the server by calling node index.js
// When we do this we get our message logged to the console, and our page visible at: http://localhost:3000/


// Next up we're askesd to install esLint
// Then we're asked to make a script to make running esLint on our js files easier. I'm not running that code at the moment as the file structure does not seem to match what I have
// Next up is: Installing the Express Application Generator
// npm install express-generator -g

// Ok we did some stuff and I think xpress created a server for us in helloworld?
// Here's the command we ran to activate the server:
// DEBUG=helloworld:* npm start



// Ok I did something...... I made a test.jade file and put some html in there, then established a corresponding rout in index.js
// I believe this is essentially what I'm supposed to do for the assignment. 
// It does't quite seem right tho because it doesn't seem easy or well organized? Idk....
// I think i should have initiated hello world in the parent directory. I think I made a Express app in a node app?
